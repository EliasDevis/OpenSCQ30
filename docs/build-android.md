## Building OpenSCQ30 on Android

### If you do not have Android Studio installed:

1. Install a JDK distribution of your choice
2. Download the [Android command line tools (scroll down a bit)](https://developer.android.com/studio), extract it to `~/Android/Sdk` (or somewhere else, this is just where Android Studio puts it), and set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to `~/Android/Sdk`.
3. Accept licenses by running `$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/bin/sdkmanager --licenses --sdk_root=$ANDROID_HOME`.
4. Check the ndk version required for the commit you have checked out (it's listed in listed in [`android/app/build.gradle.kts`](https://github.com/Oppzippy/OpenSCQ30/blob/master/android/app/build.gradle.kts), Ctrl-F ndkVersion) and [download that version of the ndk](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads), extract it to `$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/your_ndk_version_number` (and ensure symlinks are preserved), and set the `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` environment variable to `$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/your_ndk_version_number`.

### If you do have Android Studio installed:

1. Ensure the version of ndk listed in [`android/app/build.gradle.kts`](https://github.com/Oppzippy/OpenSCQ30/blob/master/android/app/build.gradle.kts) (Ctrl-F ndkVersion) is installed (File -> Settings -> Appearance & Behavior -> System Settings -> Android SDK -> SDK Tools).

### Then:

1. Install rustup
2. Add all supported cpu architecture targets: `rustup target add armv7-linux-androideabi aarch64-linux-android i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android`
3. Install [cargo-ndk](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk): `cargo install cargo-ndk`
4. In the `android` directory, run `./gradlew assembleRelease`
5. The apk can be found at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release-unsigned.apk`
