## Roadmap

This is a rough idea of the order in which I plan to do things. Items will be removed from the list when completed. If something is listed here, it doesn't mean it won't get done, but it does mean that it is further out in the future than the last listed item under current plans.

### Current Plans
1. Space A40 support
2. Abstractions to make it easier to maintain four separate frontends (gui, cli, web, android) (see below)
3. CLI rewrite using new abstractions. This will be a breaking change, and it will include new features such as setting multiple properties in one command.
4. Q45 support
5. Motion+ support
6. Liberty Air 2 support
8. Liberty 3 Pro support


### Future Plans
- Rewrite GUI using [iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced), maybe with [libcosmic](https://github.com/pop-os/libcosmic). This is (and has been since the start of OpenSCQ30) blocked by iced missing accessibility and support for IMEs.
- Distribute GUI as an AppImage again
