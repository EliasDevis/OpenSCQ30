* Features
  - Improve pairing process. Scanning is no longer necessary.
  - Add setting to disable mac address filter for device listing. 

* Fixes
  - Incorrect button action implementation for all devices. Setting actions somewhat worked, but existing actions were parsed incorrectly.
  - Life Note 3 (A3933) sound mode changes by pressing a button on the device not being handled
  - Space A40 (A3936) button action packet serialization mistake
  - State update packet parse error when the right earbud is the TWS host device
  - Connect using BR/EDR instead of BLE. All Soundcore devices support BR/EDR, but only some support BLE.
