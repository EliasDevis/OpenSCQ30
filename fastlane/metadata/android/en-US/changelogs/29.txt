* Fixes
  - Add missing soundcore mac address ranges for device detection
  - Prioritize filtering by GATT service id rather than mac address, since new mac address ranges are showing up. This isn't possible (or implemented yet) on every client, however.
  - Various Space A40 issues that prevented it from working at all
